Geometry Dash Hackermode Installation Guide

  
Please note that this guide is for version 2.1 of Geometry Dash, TASBot has not been ported to 2.2 and GDHM is in a beta missing most features and with bugs not covered in this guide.  
  
Overview  
Geometry Dash Hackermode (GDHM) is a free Geometry Dash mod menu developed by adaf with over 62 mods (and increasing). This page will contain an installation guide as well steps you can follow to fix common problems and a FAQ section.Press ctrl + f to search a problem you might have and read all of the solutions, not only the first one you see.  
  
Installation  
Before you install GDHM, make sure that you have the next requirements:  
- Have the latest Geometry Dash update (2.113)  
- Disable your antivirus before downloading GDHM.  
  
GDHM can be downloaded [here.](https://web.archive.org/web/20230402215601/https://adaf.xyz/adaf/hm/download/v35.6/8705cae3fff101c2bb6c884f5c68bda983c0955d7fa477692424cd2c727cafea/GDHM_TASBOT_v35.6.zip)  
Once you download the zip successfully, you’ll need a file extractor like [7-Zip](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.7-zip.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142184144&usg=AOvVaw331295lkecD1bDA44sEBwF) or [WinRAR](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rarlab.com&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142184221&usg=AOvVaw3U7DSjhR-tcHxiFH6jQVcP).  
Open the zip file, select all the files and without changing anything from the zip, drag them directly to the Geometry Dash folder.  
It doesn't matter if the files aren't the same as the screenshot

Once you do all the steps above, the mod should be installed now. Now open Geometry Dash and press Tab on your keyboard to open the menu.

Common Problems  
  
Why is the menu flashing?  
If the menu flashes, try disabling v-sync or install the latest version of [DirectX](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id%3D35&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142185033&usg=AOvVaw09VxduoC-af3AaQZYo4db4).  
  
Why does the menu looks like this?  
![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeUX7J3TIAmHuKkk7Yd_mIyXq1Q_yT_Nwn09X4bfTSY35wMiNMNASqxh73Gf4TYpgJUVfsUU_xgHoKJPiCyYFoQ0Zd_G9x_P2eTiLCNRIclrq19M-hmmyqVFGH-TI7NFO3yHDMIv4Hux2SVKHnSFH8-CAWZ0eM8LytoTfsP_flWafNPYjMQsbzuPEO_7NzM0BdisO1Uxg=s800?key=WSBeIFLygY4vYKC_G3WynA)

Make sure that you dragged all the files of the zip without extracting it.  
Don't put the files of the folders out, drag all the files directly from the zip to the Geometry Dash folder.  
  
Why do I only have TASBot?  
Check if your antivirus hasn't deleted any file, if it did, make an exception to the GD folder and reinstall the mod. Also make sure to not download the standalone version.  
  
Some hacks can't be enabled or disabled.  
This a bug that commonly can be fixed by reinstalling the mod.  
  
I installed everything, i don't have any overlay and the menu isn't showing.  
Make sure that the name of the game is GeometryDash.exe  
Check that all the files from the mod are there, and if they aren't there, it is very likely that an antivirus is deleting some files. Make an exception to the GD folder and to the zip of GDHM and reinstall the mod.  
  
When i open the menu everything says “NONE”  
That is where you can put keybinds to activate certain mods, just press shift to get it back to normal. If you don't like to open the keybind config with shift you can change it the same way you can assign a keybind to a mod.  
  
Why the menu looks like this?![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe7XVWXMRbyyosrU6R88V_a7DfmqGNzuqWVJMH2O-G0f2TpC3_ZZnwAg5lTytNVb2F3HenqL5GWOxQQcShGJit-Gjn4NqkybELPHMplm2osZuUAEpLdxBKnxb_kyB_d6CvUwaJay5BkgieVtBcjxR8Vcf0Py8_nmBSkEV6E0XSUMZ6UTGsGD12x647QYHsJdPwYPZ8=s800?key=WSBeIFLygY4vYKC_G3WynA)
  
Looks like that because the opacity of the menu is 0;  to change it click the gray square and a menu should come out, then move the opacity (marked with a blue arrow) to the top.

The game crashes / VCRUNTIMExxx.dll / MSVCPxxx.dll missing.  
Make sure that you have installed [Microsoft Redists](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.techpowerup.com/download/visual-c-redistributable-runtime-package-all-in-one/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142187122&usg=AOvVaw34QILbja4ecp7pfZBreMgS), [DirectX](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id%3D35&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142187234&usg=AOvVaw3YKfTuk2MKhfib_nI4wogT), [.NET Frameworks](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142187342&usg=AOvVaw0WuvH1OHhMqhiInKWkFhmK) and that you have the latest version of the game (2.113).  
If you have the game installed on steam you don't have to bother to check the game version as it should always be the latest one.  
If you installed some of the things mentioned before, reboot the pc.  
  
Sometimes the savefiles might get corrupted or just too big for the game to handle, causing a crash on start.  
To test if this is the reason of the crash, move all the .dat files from C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Local\GeometryDash to another folder (don't delete them, those files are you data from the game), then try to open the game; if it doesn't crash, is very likely that the .dat files are causing problems.  
To fix it, you can try to fix the files by using the [savefile fix](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/WEGFan/Geometry-Dash-Savefile-Fix/releases&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142188165&usg=AOvVaw3CnYuVEEVkUWcqK7KdzV0t) or apply the [4GB patch.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ntcore.com/?page_id%3D371&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142188263&usg=AOvVaw1jDfDIzMnZLFwL6TsI70ai)  
  
If some file was deleted from the GeometryDash folder it will cause the game to crash. If you didn't delete any file by yourself, read the problem “I installed everything, i don't have any overlay and the menu isn't showing.”  
  
The game can also crash when there are “corrupted” GDHM settings, to fix it delete the appdata/local/ToastedMarshmellow folder.  
  
There might also be features that cause the game to crash, those are:  
“Backward stepping”  
“Enable Lua plugin”  
  
  
The game doesn't open after changing settings of the mod  
This usually occurs when you set a custom background, changing the menu size, etc.  
To fix it, go to appdata/local/ToastedMarshmellow and delete everything from the folder.  
  
I get a “0xc000007b” error.This usually happens when the Visual Redists arent properly installed and it was instead just a singular file placed somewhere. Install [Microsoft Redists](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.techpowerup.com/download/visual-c-redistributable-runtime-package-all-in-one/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142189408&usg=AOvVaw3kMaHxTIXVXES5xYMpUujO) and [.NET Frameworks](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142189510&usg=AOvVaw1tGGA1NXVjPnLdJ0wrB9Ey) to fix it.I see the menu but it crashes when I open it.  
Don't open the menu as soon as the game loads, a level loads or if you're in creator mode. Wait a bit when the game loads, then open the menu and keep it for 2 seconds, then continue to use it normally.  
  
How can I use zBot, DDHOR or echo with GDHM?  
Since GDHM uses ImGui to show the menu, it won't work with any other mod that uses it too; it's recommended to just use TASBot to record a macro.  
  
Error that says ”the procedure entry point ?main_unload@@YAXXZ could not be located in the dynamic link library”  
This error or similar is caused by a missing or incorrect dll, to fix it put [this](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/976909727768404028/1063700160804294716/pthreadVCE2.dll&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142190349&usg=AOvVaw02rYu7KiXtnW1qdqjfJKKu) on your Geometry Dash folder.The .exe disappears.  
This problem seems to only happen on Steam and it can be fixed by clearing the downloads cache.  
Official Steam support link about how to do that:  
[https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6AD7-820D-8BE5-E51F](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6AD7-820D-8BE5-E51F&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142190724&usg=AOvVaw2cTcLnDkkPlX5tfMPsmOt8)  
  
The mod doesn't seem to update after replacing files or it doesn't detect my VIP status.  
Delete the Temp folder and reinstall the mod.  
The temp folder can be found by pressing Windows + R and then writing %temp%  
  
Discord rich presence isn't working.  
Make sure that Discord is open before opening Geometry Dash and that Discord isn't  running as administrator.  
  
I get a popup telling me to update even if i'm in the latest version.  
Delete “tbot.dll”  
  
While on practice mode the game “bugs out”.  
Turn off “Auto-Checkpoints” on the pause menu.  
  
Some features won't work.  
Backwards stepping, lua plugins and the autoclicker are currently broken on the latest version and there's no fix for it other than waiting for an update to fix it. Nobody knows when an update will happen.  
  
GDHM takes too long to load.If your connection is slow it might take longer than usual to load since it checks a server for Deluxe or VIP status. You can disable your connection temporarily.  
If this isn't the case then it be like that sometimes ..The game lags while using GDHM.You can reduce lag by disabling:  
- On “Icon Settings” tab turn off Rainbow icons  
- Tasbot might cause lag while playing, this feature is designed for making macros and not for normal play, you can try to disable it but you won't have dual fps.  
To turn it off go to the “Menu Settings” tab and turn off “Load Integrated Tasbot” then restart the game.  
- On “Core” tab > Render Hitbox > Hitbox Trail (even if it's not visible, if it was rendered at one point it will still cause lag), while showing hitboxes, go to Render Hitboxes > Enable Hitbox Trail > Reset Hitbox  
even after clicking on the reset button lag might still persist, the best way to fix it is to disable hitbox trail and then restart the game  
- On “Core” tab > Render Hitbox  
- On “Core” tab > Coin Tracker  
- On “Core” tab > Rich Level  
- If fps bypass was used, sometimes using more fps can cause an improvement. this is because the game might try to go above 60fps which might look like lag spikes  
- If you're using fps bypass use the physics fps instead of the display fps, this just works as if it was a regular fps bypass but without being visual, only affecting the physics (these only show when enabling tasbot)  
FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)  
  
The mod is a virus?  
If GDHM/TASBot was a virus:- The discord server wouldn't have more than 21k members, it wouldn't even exist in the first place, there would be multiple reports of malware since this is against Discord’s TOS. The server has been existing for [more than 2 years](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/817186388721795102/1143375325443661844/image.png&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142194045&usg=AOvVaw3P1IDsm2jszE1jUHQ5iPlN).  
- There wouldn't be more than 300 people that had paid for VIP or Deluxe.  
- Adaf wouldn’t have the reputation/trust he has, adaf has been working on gd mods for about [6 years](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DedmgIKM3aoQ&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142194319&usg=AOvVaw1UPMzG2_dTw8iiZDmmcHU-).  
- There would be a bigger downside if it was malware, the continuous gain of VIP and Deluxe statuses would be bigger and safer.  
- Thousands of people have used it for years without any report of strange behavior  
- There have been people reverse engineer GDHM and TASBot with various purposes such as knowing how a feature works and there wasn't any evidence of something suspicious.  
  
Then why do antiviruses detect it anyways?Antiviruses are designed to detect certain behaviors in a program or file but it can not know why it does that for exactly, antiviruses aren't perfect; this is a common issue called a [false positive](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/defender-endpoint-false-positives-negatives?view%3Do365-worldwide&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142195083&usg=AOvVaw16auc_a722uWjbOMve4v8u). GDHM injects code in the game to be able to function which is a behavior some malware do but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's one. Thanks to the fact that Geometry Dash isnt open source, (the actual code isn't available) this is the only way to add modifications to the game; most of the mods that exist are also detected as malware (Such as MegaHack [previously was](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/absolllute/status/1464970790709993482?t%3DbC9Vz11o6Xvgkr_eTEXKlg%26s%3D19&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142195537&usg=AOvVaw0BHQYLnx1KmbYLlZmmQO9_)).  
It would be more sensical to be skeptical if there was concrete and exact evidence of suspicious behavior; even if there are more factors to count against this, if you don't trust it simply don't use it. Nobody wins or loses anything if you do so (unless you pay for a status, obviously).  
  
The mod works with cracked versions of the game?  
Yes; some cracked versions of the game are outdated and that can cause problems with the mod, is not really about if it is cracked or not, only matters if it is the latest version of the game (2.113).  
To know if the version is correct, check that the size of the executable is exactly 6,856kb (without any modifications such as 4gb patch or menu color patch)  
  
How do I make an exception?  
The way you do an exception changes between antiviruses, there isn't a universal way to make one.  
If you have an antivirus other than Windows Defender (Windows 10), search on Google “How to make an exception on (antivirus)”  
If you use Windows Defender, go to Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Virus & threat protection then under Virus & threat protection settings, select Manage settings, and then under Exclusions, select Add or remove exclusions and add the Geometry Dash folder where the .exe is at.  
  
Can my Geometry Dash account get banned by using GDHM?  
Usually that only happens when you beat too many extreme demons, make or complete impossible levels, if you make levels with things that you can't normally do (like changing the id of a song to a invalid number) or if your stats change  drastically.  
Most bans are leaderboard bans and it won't stop you from accessing any only feature.  
Rarely you might get IP banned but it's almost always [randomly](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://steamcommunity.com/app/322170/discussions/0/3043857610274898997/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142197801&usg=AOvVaw19aiANR9DjcOiRJDOgJm6N) or if you get ratelimited.Does this work on 2.2 and will it be updated?  
It currently does not work but it might get updated sometime after. Join the Discord server for updates regarding this; there isn't an exact date for when it will happen or if it will happen at all.  
  
Why when I speedhack to 0.5 my FPS are lower?  
Did you know that the 0.5 of 60(FPS) is 30(FPS)  
Increase the FPS for smoother play while using Tasbot.  
  
Can I use a texture pack with GDHM? / Does using a texture pack affect anything to GDHM?  
GDHM doesn't affect anything regarding textures, if the texture pack doesn't work, then that's unrelated to GDHM.  
  
Why when I set the FPS Bypass it doesn't look smooth?  
Your monitor can only physically render a certain number of frames, that's what's called “Hertz”. (60Hz for example) If the FPS Bypass is set higher than what the monitor can physically render, then “screen tearing” will happen.  
If you're smart enough you might figure out that there isn't a solution to fix this “problem” other than getting a monitor with higher Hz.  
  
Why does the game lag when making or replaying a macro / rendering a video?  
The game slows down while making macros and rendering showcases for better precision and better rendering, it's called delta override and it cannot be disabled.  
  
What is the difference between Native Speedhack and Classic Speedhack?  
Classic speed hack slows down the game the same way cheat engine does while native speed hack uses the game's values to change the speed which means no fps drop and no game kicking; the only problem with native speedhack is that when a level needs very precise inputs like frame perfects, it could be problematic because native speedhack changes the physics of the game.  
  
How do I set a keybind?  
Enable “Set Keybinds” in Menu Settings, press shift, put your mouse above the text of a hack and press any key.  
  
How do I use TASBot?Join the TASBot server and read the how to use channel.  
Link to the TASBot server: [https://discord.gg/dQ4d8wkZGC](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.gg/dQ4d8wkZGC&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142200481&usg=AOvVaw2MHL2Ccdje-r0rYLnOmM4n)  
  
How do I use TASBot without GDHM?  
Download the standalone version on the download page and put it into a dll loader like [QuickLdr](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/HJfod/QuickLdr&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142200745&usg=AOvVaw09GC1k2dQPGVISrkxq_bow), [GDDLLLoader](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/adafcaefc/GDDllLoader&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1762384142200837&usg=AOvVaw0EU0qbGeW1jk4XEbNGGvOU) or MHV7 extensions folder. All of the other files included should be on the main Geometry Dash folder.For QuickLdr:  
Move the dll to “quickldr” folder and then add “tbot.dll” to settings.txt  
  
For GDDLLLoader:  
Move the dll to the “adaf-dll” folder.  
  
For MHV7:  
Move the dll to extensions.  
  
Where 's TASBot? / Where's Physics & Display FPS?  
Enable "Load Integrated TASBot" in Menu Settings and restart the game.  
  
Does the mod work with Windows 7, Mac or Android?  
GDHM works with Windows 7, 8 and 10 (it could work on older versions like Windows XP but this isn't tested yet). As for Mac and Android, it doesn't work.How do I use the mod on Linux?  
Add "WINEDLLOVERRIDES="msacm32=n,b" %command%" into Geometry Dash launch arguments in Steam

It's the same process, just replace the older files.  
  
What's the current latest public version of TASBot / GDHM?  
TASBot latest public version is v4.18  
(since v35.2 merged into one dll now GDHM and TASBot share the same version.)  
GDHM latest public version is v35.6  
  
How do I load an external mod like BetterInfo (DLL’s)?  
Move the dll to the ".GDHM\dll” folder.  
If it doesn't load properly, make sure you have [minhook.x32.dll](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook/releases/tag/v1.3.4)  in the main GD folder.  
  
How do I reset GDHM / TASBot Settings?

If you cannot delete files, restart your pc.  
  
There is a new version of the mod, that means that this guide is useless and it wont work?Most of the updates don't change the way that the mod is installed or the way common problems are fixed, so it doesn't really matter. This guide will be updated  if  something needs to be updated and you can go to the discord servers to get help.
