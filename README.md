Main sources are ILL pins, ICL #gd-resources and crmsn's #tools.


I'm currently looking into hosting some of the .dlls in this repo, I just need to check permissions.

# Getting Older versions

### Depot Downloader

Im my opinion, depot downloader is the best way to get older version

**Windows setup:** Press Win+R to open Runner, paste in this command:
```
steam://open/console
```

**Linux setup:** Close steam if it's open, and run the command:
```
steam -console
```

**2.1 download command:**
```
download_depot 322170 322171 641118531549408775
```
Robtop seems to have disabled signing into older versions, you can still build though.
If you're already logged into 2.1 somewhere, you can copy CCGameManager.dat

### GDPSs
Not as seemless as depot downloader in my experiences, but it does work.

**GDPS Hub:**
https://gdpshub.com/

You can also surf Youtube & Discord, but I won't be providing links to either.

**Be aware that some GDPS check if you have steam & GD already**

Always make sure there is a `steam_appid.txt` file with the text `322170` inside the folder

args main:
`-pix_fmt yuv420p -preset fast -crf 8`

args vf:
`colorspace=all=bt709:iall=bt470bg:fast=1`
// colour fix, very important

args audio:
`-c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k`
